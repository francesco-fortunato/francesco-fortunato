# About Me 👋

🎓 I'm a Master's student pursuing my degree in Engineering in Computer Science @ [Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/).

👨‍💻 My journey in computer science began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and Automation from Sapienza.

🚀 I'm passionate about Internet of Things (IoT), software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I love building things and solving problems with code.

💼 Currently, I'm focused on honing my skills, working on exciting projects, and learning new technologies.

## My Projects 🚀

Here are some of my last projects:

- [PaaT - Pet as a Thing](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/PaaT): An IoT-based pet tracking system that utilizes an ESP32 Heltec LoRa v2 and GPS module to track pets' movements. The system allows pet owners to monitor their pets' location, view their pets' movement history, and receive alerts when their pets leave a designated area.
- [Laser-Based Collision Avoidance System](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/Laser-Based-Collision-Avoidance-System): My bachelor thesis work on developing a sophisticated collision avoidance system for robotic applications. The system is designed to enhance robot safety and prevent collisions using laser-based technology.
