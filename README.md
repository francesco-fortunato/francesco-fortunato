# About Me 👋

🎓 Dottore Magistrale (Master of Science) in Engineering in Computer Science @ [Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/).

🚀 I'm passionate about Internet of Things (IoT), telecommunications, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I love building things and solving problems with code.

## My Projects 🚀

Here are some of my last projects:

- [GEVIS - Gene Expression Vis](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/GEVIS): A web-application based dashboard for conducting differential gene expression analysis and visualize results, facilitating interactive visualization and in-depth exploration of gene expression data. 
- [PaaT - Pet as a Thing](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/PaaT): An IoT-based pet tracking system that utilizes an ESP32 Heltec LoRa v2 and GPS module to track pets' movements. The system allows pet owners to monitor their pets' location, view their pets' movement history, and receive alerts when their pets leave a designated area.
- [Laser-Based Collision Avoidance System](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/Laser-Based-Collision-Avoidance-System): My bachelor thesis work on developing a sophisticated collision avoidance system for robotic applications. The system is designed to enhance robot safety and prevent collisions using laser-based technology.
- [DQN for Breakout Game](https://github.com/francesco-fortunato/DQN-breakout): This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to play the classic Breakout Atari game using a reinforcement learning.
